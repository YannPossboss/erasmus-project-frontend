            Hailing from the Asturia region in northwest Spain, 
            but understandably popular across the whole country, 
            fabada is an incredibly tasty dish considering how simple
            it is to make. Good quality chorizo and morcilla is the key
            to a good fabada, and if you can find cured or smoked pork 
            belly, even better! If using dried white beans, be sure to
            soak them overnight before cooking.
